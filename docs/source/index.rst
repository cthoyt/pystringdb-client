PySTRINGDB-client Documentation
===============================
`STRING <http://string-db.org/>`_ is a database of Known and Predicted Protein-Protein Interactions.
This Python library enables simple queries of the STRING API.

Currently this library only works for fetching interaction networks and their images, because that's what I needed.
Potential future plans to cover the whole API some day maybe.
